1;Sony A7R III Full-Frame Mirrorless Camera Launched in India: Price, Specifications;Sony on Tuesday launched the A7R III full-frame mirrorless camera in India. To recall, the camera had been launched last month at an event in New York, and is a refresh to the A7R II which was launched in 2015. In India, the Sony A7R III has been priced Rs. 2,64,990 for the body only, and it will go on sale from November 24. Its lens, the SEL24105G, will be priced at Rs. 1,09,990, and will go on sale on November 20.Compared to the Sony A7R II, the A7R III offers improvements like faster burst shooting, better autofocus performance and more, but fits everything in the same sized body as it predecessor.Looking at the specifications, the sensor in the new A7R III is the same 42.4-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor, but with a new front-end LSI which is said to effectively double the red out speed of the sensor. It also gets an updated BIONZ X image processor which is supposed to be about 1.8 times faster than the A7R II. This enables the camera to achieve nearly twice the burst shooting speeds compared to its predecessor, at 10fps with full autofocus when using the mechanical shutter or the electronic shutter. This lets you shoot up to 76 compressed RAW images or 28 uncompressed RAW images in burst mode. The maximum ISO as also been bumped up from ISO 25600 to ISO 32000. Autofocus speeds have improved, which now offers precise focusing in low light up to -3 EV, which an improvement of one full stop. The Eye AF is also said to have gotten an improvement in detection precision and speed.The Sony A7R III has 399 phase detection autofocus points which cover about 68 percent of the image area, and 425 contrast detection AF points. There??s 5-axis image stabilisation in the body itself, which offers 5.5 step shutter speed advantage. Sony offers a new piece of software to go with the camera, called Imaging Edge for pre and post processing work like live-view PC remote shooting and RAW development. Pixel Shift Multi Shooting is a new feature to debut with the A7R III, which shifts the sensor in 1-pixel increments to capture four separate pixel-shifted images. These four images can be composited together and processed utilising the new Imaging Edge software suite.Other improvements include a higher resolution OLED electronic viewfinder (EVF), dual SD card slots (for UHS-II and UHS-I cards) and USB Type-C (USB 3.1, Gen1) port. Sony has also added other improvements around the back of the camera which include a joystick for navigation and moving focus points, a 3-inch touchscreen for touch focus and an ??AF On?? button. The A7R III also has some rock solid video chops as it is capable of shooting 4K video, utilising the full resolution of the sensor, or in Super 35mm format, which essentially shoots at a higher resolution and then down-samples the footage to 2160x3840, thereby giving you much better detail, dynamic range and colours. It also records HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma) metadata, which lets HLG compatible HDR displays to accurately display the footage without needing any post processing. High framerate shooting is also present at 1080p 120fps.;Cameras,                                      Sony,                                      Sony A7R III,                                      Sony A7R III Price,                                      Sony A7R III Price in India,                                      Sony A7R III Specifications,                                      Sony India;https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/sony_a7r_III_india_1510657256907.jpg?output-quality=80;14-Nov-17;Gadgets 360 Staff,;Cameras;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cameras;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cameras/news/sony-a7r-iii-price-india-launch-specifications-availability-1775288
2;Panasonic Lumix G9 With 60fps Burst Shot Speed Launched, Targeted at Still Photographers;"Panasonic on Wednesday announced the Lumix G9 as its newest flagship camera - sitting alongside the videography-centric Lumix GH5. The new mirrorless Lumix camera is specifically aimed at still photographers with features such as an ultra-fast, 60fps burst shot speed and an improved five-axis in-body image stabilisation. The Japanese company will start selling the new model beginning January 2018 with a body-only price tag of?$1,699.Similar to the Lumix GH5 that was launched in India back in March, the Panasonic Lumix G9 has a 20.3-megapixel Micro Four Thirds image sensor along with a Venus engine that jointly enable the iconic 60fps burst speed in AF-S mode (fixed focus). You can also switch to 20fps in continuous AF-C that uses the built-in electronic shutter to lock objects. Both the modes enables you to capture up to 50 RAW or JPEG images. This is lower than Sony's A9 or A7R III that can capture over 200 images. However, you have also been provided with an option to use the mechanical shutter and capture up to 9fps with continuous AF to take as many as 600 JPEG or 60 RAW files.Panasonic has additionally provided a software-level tweak on the Lumix G9 through a new High Resolution mode that allows you to have 80 megapixels (equivalent) images in both JPEG and RAW formats. The camera basically combines eight images captured while shifting the sensor to give larger results than the hardware limit.If the image sensor of the Lumix G9 isn't something that persuades you to pick it as your next travelling partner, there is the upgraded image stabilisation system that helps you receive up to 6.5 additional stops of brightness. The latest Lumix flagship also has compatibility with optical image stabilisation (OIS) lenses to reduce the impact of jerks and shakes. Further, the available anti-shake system is designed for both still images as well as video files.The Lumix G9 has a 0.83x magnification electronics viewfinder that has a resolution of 3,680k dots. The natively designed viewfinder is touted to have ""zero blackout"" even for high-speed shootings. Also, there are three modes of magnification to let you capture detailed shots.Alongside the list of upgrades for top-notch still images, the Lumix G9 is capable of recording 4K videos at a frame rate of up to 60 fps. However, support to record 10-bit video footage that was acclaimed on the Lumix GH5 is missing.The Lumix G9 has Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth 4.2 wireless connectivity support alongside USB charging and dual SD card slots with the compatibility for UHS-II/V90 storage options. Moreover, the camera has a 3-inch touch-supported LCD monitor and a dust- and splash-resistant build.";Cameras,                                      Lumix G9,                                      Panasonic,                                      Panasonic Lumix G9;;8-Nov-17;Jagmeet Singh,;Cameras;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cameras;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cameras/news/panasonic-lumix-g9-launch-price-specifications-1772901
3;Drone Draft Regulations Released, Include Civil and Commercial Use;"The government on Wednesday issued draft regulations on the civil use of drones, which will also enable commercial use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for photography, doorstep delivery, and even passenger transport.The draft regulations -?arrived at after discussions with stakeholders -?would be placed in the public domain for a month to seek comments and suggestions, after which the rules would be finalised, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju otld the media in New Delhi.""By December 31, we will be in a position to come up with the final regulatory framework for the use of drones,"" Civil Aviation Secretary R.N. Choubey added.Under the draft rules issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), drones have been classified into five categories based on maximum take-off weight: nano (up to 250g), micro (251g?to two kg), mini (2kg to 25kg), small (25kg to 150kg) and large (over 150kg).""Except for nano category and those operated by government security agencies, all other commercial categories of drones will be registered by the DGCA, which will issue it a Unique Identification Number,"" Choubey said.A Civil Aviation Ministry statement said that mini and above categories will require Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit while model aircraft up to 2kg flown below 200 feet inside educational institution premises will not require permit or identification number.Remote pilots of the drones will have to undergo requisite training, except in case of nano and micro categories, the statement added.The draft rules also imposed restrictions on the use of drones in terms of no-fly zones, including area within 5km radius from an airport, within 50km from international border, beyond 500 metres of the coastline, within 5km radius of Vijay Chowk in Delhi, and from mobile platform such as moving vehicles, ships or aircraft.They would also not be permitted to fly over densely populated areas without prior approval and over areas affecting public safety or where emergency operations are underway, the statement added.Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha said once the final rules are formulated, drones could be used for tasks like wildlife photography, delivering medical supplies, e-commerce deliveries, inspection of pipelines, and even passenger transport.The purpose is to facilitate innovative applications of this technology, he said.";Drones,                                      Drones in India,                                      India,                                      Transportation,                                      Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;https://cdn.ndtv.com/tech/images/gadgets/drones_pixabay_105.jpg?output-quality=80;2-Nov-17;Indo-Asian News Service,;Transportation;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/transportation;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/transportation/news/drone-draft-regulations-released-include-civil-and-commercial-use-1770109
4;Sony Expects Best-Ever Annual Profit on Image Sensor Sales;"Japan's Sony Corp lifted its full-year operating income forecast on Tuesday, expecting to book its highest-ever profit due to strong sales of image sensors used in smartphones and other devices.The electronics firm forecast profit of JPY 630 billion ($5.57 billion) for the year ending March, from JPY 500 billion estimated three months ago.Meeting the new forecast would mean Sony exceeding its previous record of JPY 526 billion set in the year ended March 1998, when strong sales of consumer electronics including its first PlayStation games console coincided with its box-office hit ""Men in Black"".The new outlook compared with a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate of 585.81 billion yen drawn from the views of 26 analysts.Sony also said profit for July-September jumped to JPY 204.2 billion from JPY 45.7 billion a year earlier. The result is higher than the JPY 140.49 billion average estimate of 11 analysts.The semiconductor division, which include sensors, is forecast to post profit of JPY 150 billion, up 20 billion yen from an earlier estimate and a reversal from last year's loss, as it recovered from earthquake damage sustained a year ago.A business overhaul refocusing on image sensors and games under Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai has moved Sony out of a decade of doldrums and boosted the firm's stock price to nine-year highs.But the stock price has plateaued in recent months as investors have become sceptical about Sony's growth potential in coming years, when a profit boost from the earthquake recovery disappears and the PlayStation 4 console enters the late stage of its life cycle.Hoping to grow future profit pillars, Sony has been boosting investment in artificial intelligence to catch up with US?tech giants such as Amazon Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.Sony this month unveiled its Xperia Hello! voice-activated communication robot. It is also widely expected to revive robotic pets, similar to robotic dog AIBO that went on sale in 1999.It is also aiming to lead the budding virtual-reality (VR) market by gelling with the content portion of the group's business such as music and film.In sensors, the business is trying to crack into the lucrative automotive market, where demand for sensors is rising as an increasing number of cars are mounted with autonomous driving functions based on sensing technologies.??

8;Canon PowerShot G1 X Mark III With APS-C Sensor, Dual Pixel Autofocus Launched;Canon has refreshed its popular G1 X lineup with the introduction of the PowerShot G1 X Mark III. By adding an APS-C sensor from its mirrorless and DSLR range, the?PowerShot?G1 X Mark III is Canon??s first point-and-shoot camera to feature such a large sensor. The camera is scheduled to be available in November for an estimated retail price of $1,299 (roughly Rs. 84,100).?The big highlight of the PowerShot G1 X Mark III is the APS-C CMOS sensor, that??s found in Canon??s EOS M6?and EOS 77D?(Review). The body is made of magnesium alloy and features an updated DIGIC 7 image processor, optical stabilisation, RAW format support, and an articulating 3-inch LCD touchscreen. Since this is a point-and-shoot, the lens is not interchangeable so we get a fixed 24-72mm lens with a f/2.8-5.6 aperture and 3x optical zoom. The sensor has 49 focus points, an ISO range of 100-25,600, maximum shutter speed of 1/2000 sec and continuous shooting of 9fps.?The Canon PowerShot G1 X Mark III supports full-HD video recording of up to 60fps with stereo audio recording. The camera can also be charged via the Micro-USB port. There??s a Micro-HDMI port too for TV-out. There??s built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and NFC for connecting the camera to your smartphone. Battery life seems a bit disappointing as the CIPA rating is only 200 shots per charge.???As we continue to evolve the popular Canon PowerShot G-series line, we remain committed to incorporating both our latest innovations and the features photographers are looking for in an advanced, compact camera,? said Yuichi Ishizuka, president and COO, Canon U.S.A. ??With the new PowerShot G1 X Mark III, users will appreciate the quality and overall performance made possible using a APS-C sensor, alongside upgraded capabilities that can enable the capture of amazing photo and video, even in lowlight conditions.?;;https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Untitled_1508145603007.jpg?output-quality=80;16-Oct-17;Gadgets 360 Staff,;Cameras;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cameras;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cameras/news/canon-powershot-g1-x-mark-iii-launch-price-specifications-1763540

21;GoPro Bets on Upcoming Hero6, Fusion Cameras in Bid for Profitability;"GoPro forecast a smaller-than-expected loss, and said it was on track to launch the latest version of its flagship camera by the holiday season, as the company seeks to achieve its goal of returning to adjusted profitability in 2017.The company's shares were up 12 percent at $9.28 in after-market trading, and were set to wipe out their year-to-date decline if they open at that level on Friday.Once a Wall Street favorite, GoPro's body-mounted point-of-view cameras won a huge following among surfers, skydivers and other action junkies.But the company came under pressure following a series of missteps including a delay in the launch of its Karma drone and production issues with its Hero5 camera.GoPro also lost ground to feature-rich smartphones and rival products from companies such as Garmin and Sony.The company is now betting on the Hero6 and the Fusion 360 action-cameras to help bring back its followers.GoPro said during a post-earnings call on Thursday that it would realize revenue from the new products in the current quarter by shipping to customers ahead of the launch.""Hero6 will probably perform in line with expectations, and at a higher gross margin than Hero5,"" said Alicia Reese, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, adding that the management seemed to have a better handle on inventory levels this year.GoPro forecast third-quarter adjusted loss of 1 cent to 11 cents per share and revenue of $290 million to $310 million (roughly Rs. 1,973 crores), compared with analysts' estimate of a loss of 12 cents per share and revenue of $278.5 million.""We expect margins to continue to improve throughout 2017, with the introduction of new products,"" Chief Executive Nicholas Woodman said on the post-earnings call.GoPro's net loss narrowed to $30.5 million, or 22 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from $91.8 million, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, GoPro reported a loss of 9 cents per share, smaller than analysts' estimate of a loss of 25 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's operating expenses fell 35.5 percent to $130.6 million.Revenue rose to $296.5 million from $220.8 million.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $269.6 million.??

22;Google, MIT Researchers Create New AI-Based Real-Time Photo Editing;"Scientists from MIT and Google have developed a new artificial intelligence system that can automatically retouch images like a professional photographer in real time, eliminating the need to edit images after they are clicked with smartphones.The data captured by today's digital cameras is often treated as the raw material of a final image. Before uploading pictures to social networking sites, even casual cellphone photographers might spend a minute or two balancing colour and tuning contrast, with one of the many popular image-processing programs now available.The system developed by researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Google in the US is so energy-efficient and fast that it can display retouched images in real-time on phones, so that the photographer can see the final version of the image while still framing the shot.The same system can also speed up existing image-processing algorithms.The system employs machine-learning. The researchers trained their system on a dataset created by Adobe Systems, the creators of Photoshop.The data set included 5,000 images, each retouched by five different photographers. They also trained their system on thousands of pairs of images produced by the application of particular image-processing algorithms, such as the one for creating high-dynamic-range (HDR) images.The software for performing each modification takes up about as much space in memory as a single digital photo, so in principle, a cellphone could be equipped to process images in a range of styles.Researchers compared their system's performance to that of a machine-learning system that processed images at full resolution rather than low resolution.During processing, the full-resolution version needed about 12 gigabytes of memory to execute its operations.The researchers' version needed about 100 megabytes, or one-hundredth as much.The full-resolution version of the HDR system took about 10 times as long to produce an image as the original algorithm, or 100 times as long as the researchers' system.""This technology has the potential to be very useful for real-time image enhancement on mobile platforms,"" said Jon Barron from Google.""Using machine learning for computational photography is an exciting prospect but is limited by the severe computational and power constraints of mobile phones,"" said Barron.This paper may provide us with a way to sidestep these issues and produce new, compelling, real-time photographic experiences without draining your battery or giving you a laggy viewfinder experience, he said.";AI,                                      Artificial Intelligence,                                      Cameras,                                      Google,                                      MIT,                                      Mobiles,                                      Photography;;3-Aug-17;Press Trust of India,;Mobiles;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/google-mit-adobe-photo-editing-ai-machine-learning-1733136
23;Sony Reports Record Profits on Sales on Image Sensors;Japan's Sony on Tuesday reported its highest-ever first-quarter operating profit, taking the electronics giant one step toward its highest annual profit in two decades on the back of robust sales of image sensors.In a vote of confidence for Sony's turnaround under Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai, the firm's shares have risen by around 40 percent this year to nine-year highs.The box-office success of its Spider-Man: Homecoming (Review) film has also fuelled hopes of a rise in earnings for Sony's pictures business, which is working through a restructuring plan.Profit increased 2.8 times to JPY 157.61 billion ($1.43 billion or roughly Rs. 9,164 crores) in April-June, exceeding the previous first-quarter record of JPY 121.3 billion set in 2007.The result compared with a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate of JPY 129.14 billion drawn from 10 analyst views.The profit surge comes mainly as Sony's image sensor business returned to stability having recovered from earthquake damage sustained a year ago, the company said.Sony's semiconductor division, which includes image sensors, posted an operating profit of 55.4 billion yen, reversing the year-earlier loss of JPY 43.5 billion, as operations at a key plant fully resumed to meet brisk demand for image sensors for smartphones.The consumer electronics business was also profitable as it focused on high-end television sets and smartphones without seeking to increase in scale.Together, strong performance across Sony's divisions is pushing profit to golden-era levels. Nevertheless, analysts said the firm is yet to find long-term drivers of growth.With the future in mind, Sony is using its newly recovered financial strength to venture into acquisitions. On Monday, it said it had bought most of the distributor of the English-language versions of Dragon Ball Z and One Piece animations.The firm maintained its profit forecast of JPY 500 billion for the year ending March.While that is below the market's average forecast of JPY 562.19 billion, it would still be the highest since the company made JPY 526 billion in the year ended March 1998, when it enjoyed strong sales of its first PlayStation games console and other electronics. It also benefited from box-office hit Men in Black.??

24;GoPro QuikStories Automatic Story Creation Feature Launched for Android and iOS;Popular action camera maker, GoPro, has added a new feature to its GoPro mobile app called QuikStories. The features automatically pulls clips shot by your GoPro Hero5 series cameras and creates a ready-to-share video clip. The new feature is available alongside an update to the GoPro app (formerly known as Capture) on Android and iOS, while it currently supports only the Hero5 series of action cameras.We had a chance to try this out at the launch in Mumbai and it actually works as seamlessly as GoPro says. Before you get started, your Hero5 camera will need the latest firmware update for this to work, which should happen automatically once the camera is connected to the app. Next, you??ll need the latest versions of the GoPro and Quik apps installed. The app will need both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled as the files are transferred over Bluetooth in the background. Once you start shooting, you get a little prompt for syncing the footage. One you press Get it, the video and photos shot within the last 72 hours will start syncing to your phone. You can turn the auto syncing option off in the settings if needed. The imported clips also have an expiry of seven days, so if you want a particular clip to stay longer, you??ll have to manually save it.GoPro recommends shooting at 1080p resolution as the output clip will eventually be converted to a 720p video file. The higher resolution you shoot in, the longer the conversion process will take. Other than footage captured by the GoPro, you can also mix in videos and photos from your existing library. The GoPro app will send you a notification when a story is ready. Before saving and sharing it, you can customise it. You can choose from a range of transition effects, add text to parts of the clip, trim the individual video clips, add a background track and add various filters. Only photos and videos shot in the standard mode are usable as you can??t use videos and photos from timelapse or burst shots.??QuikStories is our biggest leap forward since the invention of the GoPro itself,? says GoPro founder and CEO, Nicolas Woodman. ??QuikStories is the simple storytelling solution our customers have been dreaming about for years. It??s an absolute game changer,? he adds.;GoPro action cameras,                                      GoPro Android app,                                      GoPro Hero5,                                      GoPro iOS app,                                      GoPro Quik,                                      GoPro QuikStories,                                      GoPro QuikStories launch;https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/gopro_quikstories_cover_ndtv_1501244448907.jpg?output-quality=80;28-Jul-17;Roydon Cerejo,;Apps;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/gopro-quikstories-app-feature-android-ios-1730479
25;Xiaomi-Backed Yi Technologies Brings Its Action and Security Cameras to India;Xiaomi-backed Yi Technologies is known for its budget-friendly action and digital cameras that can challenge the likes of GoPro. Having already established a base in China, the US and Europe, the company has now made its way to the Indian market. Yi Technologies has launched two of its action cameras in the country, the Yi Action Camera and Yi 4K Action Camera, both of which are available on Amazon for Rs. 6,990 and Rs. 17,990, respectively. It has also launched two security cameras, Yi Home IP Camera and Yi Dome IP Camera, priced at Rs. 2,990 and Rs. 4,990, respectively.The action cameras from the Xiaomi-backed company are priced a lot less compared to similar products from GoPro. The Yi Action camera features a 16-megapixel Sony IMX206 lens and an Amarelle A7LS image processing chipset. The camera has the ability to record 1080p videos at 60fps and includes Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity options.The Yi 4K Action Camera, as the name suggests, adds 4K capabilities, allowing it to shoot 4K videos at 30fps. It features a 2.19-inch display with Corning Gorilla Glass protection. It also features 12-megapixel f/2.8 Sony IMX377 sensor with EIS and 7P lens.

26;Sony A9 Full-Frame Mirrorless Camera Launched in India at Rs. 3,29,990;"Sony has launched the Sony A9, its flagship full-frame mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, in India. Unveiled globally back in April, the Sony A9 comes to India at a price of Rs. 3,29,990. The camera goes on sale from July 29 via all major Sony retail outlets across the country. The Sony A9 takes the best of Sony??s camera technologies (be it mirrorless or DSLR) and crams it into a body that??s smaller than most DSLRs in the market.Some of the highlights of the Sony A9 include high-speed, blackout-free continuous shooting at up to 20fps, 60 AF/AE tracking calculations per second, and a maximum shutter speed of up to 1/32,000 second. At the heart of all this is the new 35mm full-frame stacked 24.2-megapixel Exmor RS sensor, which enables data processing speeds that are up to 20x faster than its previous full-frame models.

29;Hydrogen One Is Camera Maker Red's First Smartphone;"Camera maker Red is making its foray into the smartphone space. On Wednesday, the company announced a phone called the Hydrogen One, which, the company claims, will be ""the world??s first holographic media machine.""In a jargon-laden blog post, the company boasts of the Red Hydrogen??s display, camera capabilities, sound system, and support for modularity, a familiar feature that several companies including Motorola and LG have explored in recent years. At least one module will focus on higher quality motion.The Red Hydrogen One smartphone features a ""retina-riveting"" display, which supposedly springs between ""3D"" and 2D modes depending on the content. One would be able to enjoy such content with wearing glasses, the company claims.?About that, Red has also announced a channel where it will offer ""4-view holographic"" content.The Red Hydrogen One will work with Red??s professional camera program (it's unclear if one would actually be able to plug their Red DSLR cameras), and offer familiar user interface and monitor. Much like several recent flagship phones, the Red Hydrogen One will also comes equipped with a USB-C port, but interestingly also has a microSD card should you need more storage. A 3.5mm headphone jack will also be present.The Red Hydrogen runs Android with several proprietary features such as ""H3O algorithm that converts stereo sound into multi-dimensional audio."" We will have to wait to find out what exactly that means but the company says that the sound experience would be as good as plugging 5.1 audio out headphones.Which brings us to the least exciting parts about the Red Hydrogen One. The phone comes in two variants: Aluminium, which will retail at $1,195 (roughly Rs. 77,350); and Titanium, which will retail at $1,595 (roughly Rs. 103,250).

Google has also confirmed that the Daydream team is working with several manufacturers to build cameras from the ground up for VR180 video format.The company says that the new VR180 video will ensure what's in front of the user is high resolution, and ""look great on desktop and on mobile."" YouTube's main focus is to boost VR with the new video format as it can be seen on phones with regular 2D screens as well as VR headsets like Cardboard, Daydream, and other headsets which show images stereoscopically in 3D. The new video format will enable depth, where ""near things look near, and far things appear far,"" adds Wojcicki. Additionally, the VR180 format also supports live streaming videos.Google has named some partners like YI, Lenovo, and LG who are working with the company to bring new cameras priced same as a regular point-and-shoot camera.

Z Cam will be one of Google's first partners under the program.""We want to make VR more accessible and more affordable for viewers and creators. The reality is, filming 360-degree VR videos isn't easy for most creators and some VR cameras are expensive. That's why I'm thrilled that YouTube and Daydream have worked together on a new format, VR180, and new cameras, which make it easy and affordable for anyone to make VR videos,"" said Wojcicki.Wojcicki also revealed that now, 1.5 billion logged in viewers visit YouTube every single month and on an average, viewers spent over an hour a day watching YouTube on mobile devices alone.

Netgear calls the Arlo Pro a ??wire-free, weatherproof HD camera? and claims that it has a wide 130-degree field of view. The Arlo Pro uses two rechargeable batteries and that means you can place it inside or outside your home. There??s no need to connect the camera to a power socket but in case you want to do that, the option is available. The Arlo Pro system launched in India is model VMS4230, which comes with two security cameras (with rechargeable batteries) and one base station, and it has been priced at Rs. 44,900.An interesting feature of the Netgear Arlo Pro is two-way audio.?This means that you can use this camera to talk to people standing near it, which could prompt some people to use this as a video doorbell. You can even monitor children from a different room such as the kitchen and keep talking to them while you cook.Netgear says the Arlo Pro has instant motion alerts and a smart siren, which are targeted at alerting you about intruders. The siren is rated at over 100 decibels and could be an important deterrent for potential intruders. The camera also has night vision so it is useful both during the day and night. The camera is capable of providing HD video in complete darkness, thanks to its RGB-IR night vision technology. Netgear claims this tech illuminates the scene evenly and provides crisp details about things happening both near and far from the camera. Its passive motion sensor can detect movement up to 7 metres away from the camera and send an alert to your phone.The companion app for Netgear Arlo Pro also has some new features. It now lets you arm or disarm the camera based on your location or schedule. The app is also available on Apple TV, which can be used to view camera feeds on the big screen. Netgear says Arlo can be connected to other smart home devices through services such as IFTTT and Samsung SmartThings.Netgear claims that the Arlo Pro will get smart motion recognition technology later this year, which will use machine learning algorithms to identify people, cars, animals, among other things. This will allow the camera to send alerts for specific objects, species, or people, Netgear says.Arlo??s free cloud storage allows you to record and store videos for seven days for free. You can connect up to five Arlo cameras to the cloud without paying any subscription fees.

35;Nest Cam IQ Launched, a Smart 4K Monitoring Camera With Motion Detection;Nest is an Alphabet-owned company that has been under the radar for a long while now. The company, which was founded by Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, is remembered for its thermostat that synchs to the Internet and learns from user habits. After years of dormancy and Fadell's departure in 2016, Nest has once again risen with a new intelligent indoor monitoring camera called the Nest Cam IQ.The circular shape of the camera looks quite similar to the thermostat, but it is an entirely different product which is priced at $299 (roughly Rs. 19,200). The Nest Cam IQ comes with a 4K video sensor for capturing videos. But the camera doesn't always use the higher resolution. Instead, it normally shoots 1080p footage, and keeps the 4K capabilities for important matters like detecting when something is wrong at home, or when an intruder breaks in.The intelligent Nest Cam IQ will send an alert if it notices anything funny in its visual range. There a few neat ways in which it does this. It uses Google's deep learning technology to detect movement in field of view and send alert with a zoomed in capture of the person in the view. There's also what the company calls Nest Aware that is able to recognise faces, and pick up audio sounds for alarm due to the camera's powerful hexa-core processor, but they will only be available if you subscribe to the Nest Aware service at $10 per month or $100 annually.Over at the back of the camera, there's a notable speaker grille that can loudly alert and scare off intruders, and can act as a microphone with noise cancellation for a clearer sound. The camera also comes with a night vision mode thanks to its two infrared LEDs which are almost invisible to the human eye. There's a multicolor LED on the outer rim that lets you know when the Nest Cam IQ's camera is active.The Nest Cam IQ is currently available for pre-order in the US with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Ireland to follow soon. Germany, Austria, Italy, and Spain will also get to pre-order the camera on June 13, and the first batch of Cam IQs will be shipped by the end of the month.;Alphabet,                                      Cameras,                                      Google,                                      Nest,                                      Nest Cam IQ,                                      Smart Camera;;31-May-17;Sanket Vijayasarathy,;Cameras;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cameras;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cameras/news/nest-cam-iq-price-release-date-specifications-smart-4k-monitoring-camera-1706296
36;Essential Products Is Part of Andy Rubin's Playground Global Incubator;"Andy Rubin created the software that powers hundreds of millions of Android devices around the world. Now he has two gadgets of his own: the Essential Phone and the Essential Home.The phone's display fills most of the front, save for a camera cutout, slim bezels and a small chin at the bottom. The almost full-screen display echoes a design popularised earlier this year by Samsung Electronics's Galaxy S8 handset and soon to be followed by Apple with a revamped iPhone. The Essential Home is a puck-sized, voice-controlled gadget that can control appliances and provide reminders. Also see??Father of Android??

With the new products, Rubin is betting he can take on Apple and Samsung, which have dominated consumer hardware in recent years.The Essential handset includes many modern smartphone technologies, including a Qualcomm processor and a USB-C port for charging. Uniquely, it includes a magnetic connector on the back to connect to such accessories as a camera that takes 360-degree photos and a wireless charging hub. Without the attachment, the phone has an 8 megapixel camera on the front and a 13 megapixel sensor on the rear, according to Essential's website.

37;Intel Unveils Drones for Advanced Pitch Analysis at ICC Champions Trophy 2017;Intel on Tuesday unveiled three new technologies that will be used during the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 ?? a major cricket tournament that begins in the United Kingdom on June 1. The new technologies announced on Tuesday are advanced pitch analysis via an Intel drone, a bat sensor powered by an Intel Curie module, and a virtual reality experience for cricket fans who visit stadiums.The Intel Falcon 8 Drone has been equipped with infrared and HD cameras to be used for pitch analysis during Champions Trophy matches. The drone will offer data on grass cover, grass health, and topology. This will help generate daily pitch reports and commentators will use that to analyse the pitch during live broadcasts of the match on TV and over the Internet. The pitch is one of the most important aspects of cricket and it has the power to decide which way each game swings, so this analysis is likely to prove useful.Intel, which is the Official Innovation Partner for the ICC Champions Trophy 2017, says the new bat sensor, called Speculur BatSense, can be mounted on any cricket bat and will be able to measure back-lift, bat speed, and follow through for every stroke a batsman plays. Many players will be using this during the Champions Trophy and it will allow for data such as speed of the ball after it hits the bat to be shown on TV.Intel has plans for these sensors beyond the ICC Champions Trophy 2017. In a statement, Speculur Managing Director Atul Srivastava said, ??Coaches can use their insights and expertise along with the bat sensor data to make specific adjustments to a batsman??s technique ultimately helping him perform better.? The company will bring this technology to the market later in 2017 and it will first be available in Australia, India, US, and UK.Finally, Intel is also going to showcase VR cricket experiences at The Oval (London) and Edgbaston (Birmingham) stadiums. This is a fun experience where people will be able to play cricket in virtual reality. With a VR headset mounted, people can test their batting skills against virtual bowlers. The bat used for this will use Intel??s Curie module and offer data on people??s bat speed and back-lift, among other stats.;Champions Trophy,                                      Champions Trophy 2017,                                      Cricket,                                      ICC,                                      ICC Champions Trophy 2017,                                      Intel;https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/intel_curie_speculur_batsense_1496152660726.jpg?output-quality=80;30-May-17;Pranay Parab ,;Cameras;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cameras;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cameras/news/icc-champions-trophy-2017-intel-drone-batsense-cricket-1705849

40;Sony's New G-Series Solid State Drives for Professional Video Recorders Launched in India;"Sony on Thursday launched its new G-series solid state drives, SV-GS96 and SV-GS48, in India. The new SSDs from the company are meant for the storage needs of professional video recorders and will be made available in the third week of May. The SV-GS96 SSD comes with a storage capacity of 960GB and SV-GS48 comes with 480GB of storage. The storage drives have been priced at Rs. 47,500 and Rs. 25,500 respectively.The new G-series solid state drives achieve read speeds up to 550Mbps and have been claimed to have 10 years of lifespan, as per company's claims. ""Using Sony's Error Correction Code technology, the 960GB G Series SSD achieves up to 2400 TBW (terabytes written), while the 460GB drive can reach 1200 TBW, resulting in less frequent replacement and increased ROI. 2400 TBW translates to about 10 years of use for the SV-GS96, if data is fully written to the drive and average of five times per week,"" the company said in its release.Notably, Sony says that while data write speeds usually drop suddenly for other SSDs after repeated re-write cycles, the new G-series drives feature a built-in technology that prevent these speeds from slowing down.The SV-GS96 and SV-GS48 storage drives come with data protection technology that has been claimed to keep the content secure and intact, even in case of sudden power failures.""Building on the reliability synonymous with Sony's Professional Media products, the new SSDs are a solid option for respective video recorders, offering videographers stable high-speed capabilities, a sense of security and lower cost of ownership due to their longer life,"" the company said.The new Sony G-series solid state drives will be made available across all Sony Center and other major electronic stores across India.

41;DJI Spark Launched: Company's Cheapest and Most Compact Drone;"When you think of DJI, the first thing that comes to mind is expensive and rather bulky but powerful drones. However, your perception might soon change as DJI on Monday launched 'Spark', which is not just the cheapest drone made by the company but also its most compact one yet. With a starting price of just Rs. 43,000 ($499 in the US) in India, DJI Spark is a mini camera drone that brings along some new features that have previously not been seen on DJI drones.The new DJI drone weighs just around 300 grams and is comparable to a soda can in terms of size. DJI Spark has a maximum flight time of up to 16 minutes, is capable of recording 1080p videos, and comes with a 12-megapixel sensor for taking still images. ""Spark's 2-axis mechanical gimbal and UltraSmooth technology dramatically reduce shake and rolling shutter effect to capture cinematic shots effortlessly,"" the company said in its release.Moving to the highlight of the new drone, DJI Spark can be controlled with hand movements. With the PalmControl feature, for the first time in a drone by DJI, the Spark's movement can be controlled by users by just using their hands.""Controlling a camera drone with hand movements alone is a major step towards making aerial technology an intuitive part of everyone's daily life, from work and adventure to moments with friends and family,"" said Paul Pan, Senior Product Manager at DJI. In case you don't prefer hand movements, you can always choose to control the drone with your smartphone.Apart from PalmControl, DJI Spark comes with Quickshot feature, which creates 10-second video from flight to easily share on social media. Some of the other features from DJI including TapFly and ActiveTrack can also be found on the new mini drone from the company.DJI Spark can reach maximum speeds of up to 50kmph and with Sport Mode, the camera flies with you as you move along. While the new drone comes with some of DJI's other shooting modes, it introduces two new modes, i.e. Pano and ShallowFocus.""In Pano Mode, the camera creates horizontal or vertical panoramas by automatically adjusting its gimbal and heading, taking a series of pictures and stitching them together. ShallowFocus allows you to put part of a picture into sharp focus while the rest of the image is softened, creating photographs with a shallow depth of field,"" the company said in its release.Apart from the main camera, the DJI Spark comes with a downward-facing vision system, a forward-facing 3D Sensing System, dual-band GPS and GLONASS, a high-precision inertial measurement unit, and 24 powerful computing cores, as per the company.The standard DJI Spark kit will include an aircraft, a battery, a USB charger and three pairs of propellers. Users can also choose to get their hands on the Spark Fly More Combo, which includes an aircraft, two batteries, four pairs of propellers, a remote controller, propeller guards, a charging hub, a shoulder bag and all necessary cables, with a retail price of Rs. 60,000.The shipping of the drone has been estimated to start from June 15 in the US and each user can only purchase a maximum of two units due to limited availability. Further, the company is also giving away a 16GB microSD card with the DJI Spark.Just like some of the other recent drones from DJI, the Spark flies back to the preset home point when user presses the Return to Home (RTH) button, the battery gets too low, or the connection is lost.DJI Spark has been launched in Alpine White, Sky Blue, Meadow Green, Lava Red, and Sunrise Yellow colours but the company says that the availability of different colours might depend on the different sales channels.";Cameras,                                      DJI,                                      DJI Drone Launch,                                      DJI Spark India Launch,                                      DJI Spark India Price,                                      Home Entertainment,                                      India,                                      Transportation;;25-May-17;Shekhar Thakran,;Transportation;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/transportation;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/transportation/news/dji-spark-drone-price-in-india-launch-cheapest-compact-drone-1703818
42;Sony's Image Sensor Business Drives Company Turnaround;"Sony Corp said on Friday it expects annual operating profit to surge 73.2 percent, closing in on a two decade-old record, as its cash-cow image sensor business recovers from quake damage and enjoys strong demand from smartphone vendors.Sony forecast profit to reach JPY 500 billion ($4.50 billion or roughly Rs. 28,877 crores) in the financial year through March 2018 from JPY 288.7 billion (roughly Rs. 16,670 crores) a year prior, when earnings were roughly in line with a revised estimate announced earlier this month.The outlook compared with the JPY 510.58 billion (roughly Rs. 29,483 crores) average of 27 analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.If achieved, profit would be at its highest since peaking at JPY 525.7 billion (roughly Rs. 30,357 crores) in the year through March 1998, when strong consumer electronics sales combined with the popularity of the first PlayStation console and box-office hit ""Man in Black"".Profit is nearing that of Sony's golden era after a massive overhaul under Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai, including exiting the laptop business and downsizing television set operations.Image sensors are now likely to be the biggest contributor to the profit growth, as operations at a factory damaged by earthquakes a year ago have returned to normal at a time when smartphone vendors are increasingly adopting dual-lens rear cameras in their handsets, requiring extra sensors.Sony forecast its chip division, which includes image sensors, to book an operating profit of JPY 120 billion, compared with the previous year's loss of JPY 7.8 billion.The firm expects profit in the gaming business - another growth-driver - to expand 25.4 percent. It anticipates a slight decline in sales of PlayStation 4 consoles but expects to benefit from online businesses.Sony expects its pictures segment - which it has said is in need of restructuring - to return to profit after a $1 billion writedown in the previous year.??

Now the company has announced two new cameras, Yi Halo and Yi 360 VR, for professional users and consumers, respectively.Coming first to the Yi Halo, the camera has been developed in partnership with Google and is especially targeted at professionals. The Yi Halo camera comes with 17 camera units in total and allows users to showcase their creativity while creating VR content. The camera has been developed to work with Google's Jump professional virtual reality platform. Yi Halo comes with support for various image quality settings including ISO, WB, EV, shutter, and flat colour. Further the newly launched VR camera is capable of shooting videos in 8K resolution at 30fps and 5K resolution at 60fps.""We designed the Yi Halo to be modular and upgradeable. When new firmware is released, you can upgrade all cameras at once with just a few clicks on the control panel. In the unlikely event a Yi Halo unit camera is damaged in the field, simply replace it with one of the two included spare cameras. When new Yi Halo unit camera hardware is released, simply replace the existing unit camera to upgrade the Yi Halo,"" the company says on its website.The Yi Halo camera is powered by an 18 Ambarella A9SE75 chipset. It comes with built-in Wi-Fi, sports a 2.2-inch LCD screen with 640x360 pixel resolution, and can be controlled using an Android smartphone app as well. The camera offers a battery life of 100 minutes in video recording. The Yi Halo has been priced by the company at $16,999 (roughly Rs. 10,93,000) and will be made available late summer this year.Moving on to the Yi 360 VR, the consumer-centric camera, as the name suggests, it can record videos and pictures in 360-degrees. It is capable of recording videos with 5.7K resolution at 30fps. The camera weighs just around 170 grams and can be easily carried around by users.
